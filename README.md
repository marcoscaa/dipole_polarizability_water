# Dipole and polarizability data of water and ice
 
This repo contains the data used to train DeepMD models
of the dipole and static polarizability of water and ice.
For more details about the format of the training data,
please see the [DeepMD-kit documentation](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/stable/data/    data-conv.html#raw-format-and-data-conversion).

The dipole and polarizability of water were derived using
Maximally Localized Wannier Functions, and they are reported
as molecular (not global) quantities.

For more details about how the data were collected, please

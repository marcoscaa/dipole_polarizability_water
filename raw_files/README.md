# Dipole and polarizability data of water and ice

This repo contains the data used to train DeepMD models
of the dipole and static polarizability of water and ice.
For more details about the format of the training data, 
please see the [DeepMD-kit documentation](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/stable/data/data-conv.html#raw-format-and-data-conversion).
